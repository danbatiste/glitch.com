Using Glitch is easy! To get started, simply create an account and log in. Then, you can create a new project and start coding. Once you have created your project, you can use the code editor to write and edit your code. You can also use the file manager to upload and manage your files. Finally, you can use the web server to deploy your application. Once your application is deployed, you can share it with the world or keep it private. You can also use the Glitch community to find help and resources to make your application even better.

To create a web application, you can use the code editor to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. You can also use the library of pre-built components to quickly create a functional web application. Additionally, you can use the powerful API to create custom components and integrate them into your application. Finally, use the built-in debugger and linter to identify and fix errors.
